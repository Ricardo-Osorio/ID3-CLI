# Interactive cli tool to fetch and edit ID3 tags

CLI tool to find song matches for mp3 files and help tag these with the correct [ID3](https://id3.org/) tags (v2).

This process is interactive and guides the user through multiple steps while cycling through a music library.

It utilises song fingerprints which in turn are matched with the help of the [AcoustID](https://acoustid.org/) service. More on registering for a client API [here](https://acoustid.org/webservice).

This is just a "weekend" project but PRs are welcome.
